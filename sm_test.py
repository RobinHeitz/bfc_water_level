"""
Pico runs at 125 MHz. The min. state machine (sm) frequency is 1908 Hz.
If the frequency is set to 1MHz, it should result in one cycle every 1 us, thats enough accuracy.

TRIGGER is set to gpio 6 (pin 9) -> Set pin
ECHO is set to gpio 7 (pin 10) -> Input pin

- Set trigger to HIGH for 10us
- Count duration of ECHO beeing HIGH
